  <h1>Stratagems: Unleashing Tactical Madness</h1>
</Hero>

<p>
  In the unforgiving battlegrounds of the galaxy, every Helldiver knows that survival depends on more than just firepower - it requires strategy, cunning, and the judicious use of Stratagems. These tools of war are not to be taken lightly; they are the instruments through which we assert our dominance over the alien menace and uphold the values of <strong>freedom</strong> and <strong>democracy</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  When faced with overwhelming odds, Stratagems offer a lifeline - a means to turn the tide of battle in our favor. Whether it's calling in a precision strike to eliminate high-priority targets, deploying automated defenses to fortify our positions, or requisitioning vital supplies to sustain our fight, every Stratagem serves a critical purpose in our mission to secure liberty for all.
</p>

<p>
  But make no mistake: utilizing Stratagems requires discipline, coordination, and a clear understanding of the battlefield. Each deployment must be calculated, each decision made with the utmost care. For in the crucible of war, there is no room for error - only the cold, unyielding reality of victory or defeat.
</p>

<p>
  So, soldier, when the fate of humanity hangs in the balance, remember the importance of your Stratagems. They are not mere tools; they are the difference between triumph and oblivion. With each activation, you reaffirm your commitment to the cause and strike fear into the hearts of our alien adversaries. Use them wisely, use them decisively, and may they lead us to victory against the forces of tyranny and oppression.

<p class="mt-1 font-tiny"><em>Unauthorized or reckless use of Stratagems without just cause may result in disciplinary action, including but not limited to reduction in pay, immediate termination, or more severe consequences if called for.</em></p>
