<h1>MG-43 Machine gun</h1>

<p>Behold, soldier, the mighty MG-43 Machine Gun - a weapon fit for heroes and hotheads alike. This trusty companion is your ticket to glory on the battlefield, but beware, for with great power comes great responsibility (and a hefty kickback).</p>

<p>Now, let's talk tactics. The MG-43 is your go-to for those "oh crap" moments when you're faced with bug breach hordes or pesky large enemies. But here's the catch - <strong>ammo is scarce</strong>, so it's like momma always said: "Use it wisely, or you'll be walking home."</p>

<p>When it comes to accuracy and control, remember this mantra: "Stationary is the new black." <strong>Plant your feet</strong>, soldier, and watch as your shots hit the mark with precision. And if you really want to show those bugs who's boss, get low - <strong>crouch for stability</strong> or go full commando and hit the dirt for maximum accuracy.</p>

<p>Now, about armor penetration - the MG-43 may not cut through armor like a hot knife through butter, but it'll sure give those enemies a run for their money. So when you see a tough bug or a sturdy automaton, don't be afraid to lay down some suppressive fire and watch those bullets find their mark.</p>
